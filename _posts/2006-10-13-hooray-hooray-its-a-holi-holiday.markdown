I'll be leaving for the middle of nowhere (somewhere situated in France) tomorrow. It's going to be my first holiday in two years so I am really looking forward to it.

If you wish to contact me, you are in bad luck as I won't be available through modern communication systems (homing pigeons might work though). It's going to be an 'internetless' week which has it's pros and cons.

One more request to you LazyWeb: adhere to your name and please don't blog for a week. I don't want to spend two days sifting through my feed reader when I get back. ;)
