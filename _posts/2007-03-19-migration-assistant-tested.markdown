[Michael Larabel tested Ubuntu's Migration Assistant](http://www.michaellarabel.com/?k=blog&i=116 "Ubuntu's Migration Assistant Works!") [I blogged about yesterday](/2007/03/17/feisty-impressions-1-migration-assistant.html "Feisty Impressions #1: Migration Assistant"). It seems to work well although it does have a few disadvantages (at the moment):

- **No e-mail import** This is a really big disadvantage. It's probably the most important feature a migration assistant should have. It's a mystery to me why this wasn't the first feature implemented in this project.
- **No Linux > Linux import** I read somewhere that this is a target for the Migration Assistant developers so it will be in there soon I hope. It's not the most important feature when considering the prime target for the application, Windows users (at least in my opinion), but let's hope this will get in soon.
