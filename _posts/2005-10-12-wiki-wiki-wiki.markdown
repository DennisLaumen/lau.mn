Being inspired by [Loe](http://lgespee.blogspot.com) I checked out the [Dutch Ubuntu Wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com//DutchTeam) today.

Loe told me the Dutch [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) wasn't very filled yet (is filled the verb to use in this context?) and contained some minor spelling errors and small inconsistencies.

Inspired by his remarks I went on a little Wiki hunt and corrected some of the aforementioned  errors and inconsistencies. It was my first time editing a Wiki so I sure hope I didn't screw things up. *Dennis crosses his fingers*

I also added a little page of my own to link to when people click my name in the Wiki. I did this because the Wiki created a link to a not-yet created page called [DennisLaumen](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DennisLaumen). I sure hope this is acceptable behaviour because I have no idea about Wiki etiquette (Wikiquette?).

If anyone can give me some tips on this matter I would be gratefull.

I'm gonna call it a day, good night!
