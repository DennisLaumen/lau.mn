Last week I borrowed a colleague's **iPod FM Transmitter**. My current rental car's audio system **doesn't**[![](http://dennislaumen.nl.business9.webhosting.transip.nl/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/k33185-14500.jpg)](http://dennislaumen.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/kensington-ipod-fm-transmitter.jpg) **play MP3's** so an FM transmitter for my iPod would be great. The Kensington iPod FM Transmitter allows you to stream the iPod's music on a random **FM frequency**.

I was really excited before trying the device! The features it promises are **exactly what I need**. If the device would work that is. In two one-hour drives I **didn't find a single frequency** which gave me even mediocre sound quality! I wasn't expecting crisp and clear audio but this **wasn't audible**. It was mostly just some **noise mixed with some bits of the music** your iPod's playing.I was really **disappointed** with the device. I expected a lot from it but it didn't even deliver on it's core features. It worked on two of my colleague's cars though so it's probably just incompatible with my car.
