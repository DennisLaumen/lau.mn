[LinuxWorld Expo](http://www.linuxworldexpo.nl) was last week and it was a disappointment! I enjoyed myself, that's for sure but it was really small and not organized very well in my opinion. Setting up vendor sessions next to bulldozers (or something that sounds pretty similar ;)) isn't the wisest choice one could make.It wasn't all bad though... I had a nice day and I got to catch up with some [Ubuntu-NL](http://planet.ubuntulinux.nl) people as well as meet some people I hadn't met before like [Nico](http://www.ossfi.nl/drupal/blog), SWAT (to whom I can't link because he hates blogging :D) and some other folks whose nicknames and/or real names I can't remember.

I started experimenting with [Python](http://www,python.org) and [pyGTK](http://www.pygtk.org/). It's a pretty cool language so far and the GTK way of building GUI's is great as well!

Last but certainly not least I had some time this week to play some [Civilization IV](http://2kgames.com/civ4/) and oh my... [Sid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier) did it again.... 

One... More... Turn...
