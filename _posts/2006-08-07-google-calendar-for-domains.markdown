Long time no blog... (As usual)

[I completely forgot to blog that I *do* have Google Calendar incorporated in my GMail for Domains](http://blog.dfile.nl/archives/103 "GMail for Domains"). I had an e-mail conversation with Google and apparently the Google Calendar integration is only available in the English user interface. Once I switched to English everything worked like a charm.

Google's e-mail support was pretty good on this. They were really quick to reply (not something very common among big companies) and very nice and helpful.
