Okay, just upgraded my [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) blog to 2.0. All looks fine and dandy so far... (except for some small issues which I will address later on in this blog post)

Just a little disappointed with the new release. Not much has changed. The admin panel has had some usability tweaks and I now have the excellent [Akismat](http://akismet.com/) anti-comment spam (as it requires the 2.0 release).

Some parts of the admin interface look really screwed up though. The buttons are almost unreadable (light blue and darker blue color with a thin black font) and the link to the dashboard in the admin panel isn't correct. Beneath the "Write Post" textbox it shows the Dashboard though... very weird...

Maybe [spacey](http://users.lichtsnel.nl/~spacey/ "Herman Bos") has had similar issues during his upgrade (*hint, hint*). I'll keep you posted on my upgrade issues (maybe I will post some screenies later on).
