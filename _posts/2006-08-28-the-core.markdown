Anybody who has seen the movie [The Core](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298814 "The Core") knows how I feel at the moment. Disgusted by realizing you are watching an absolute low in recent film history but fascinated by it at the same time. What the hell were the creators of this monstrosity thinking? Did they even read the script before the recordings started?

Anyway, The Core's story in a nutshell according to the almighty [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Core "The Core"): 

> "It concerns a team who have to drill to the center of the Earth and set off a series of nuclear explosions in order to restart the rotation of Earth's core."

Trust me, your eyes are not deceiving you. It's a movie about rebooting the Earth's core.

Among others (including Stanley Tucci, a pretty good actor, who probably needed some quick bucks) it stars [DJ Qualls](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0702809/ "DJ Qualls") as the world's best hacker: Taz 'Rat' Finch (it remains a mystery why someone named Taz needs a nickname but here you have it). He delivers some "great" lines:

> Taz 'Rat' Finch: How many languages do you speak?

> Dr. Conrad Zimsky: Five, actually.

> Taz 'Rat' Finch: I speak one. One Zero One Zero Zero. With that I could steal your money, your secrets, your sexual fantasies, your whole life. In any country, any time, any place I want. We multitask like you breathe. I couldn't think as slow as you if I tried.

**Update**: Oh yeah, they save the world with [Unobtanium](http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-uno1.htm "Unobtanium") (and [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtainium "Unobtanium")).
