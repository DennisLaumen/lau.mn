Yesterday I spotted the new free Dutch news paper 'De Pers' for the first time. I hadn't seen a copy yet because they apparently have some distribution problems so they aren't distributing it in Limburg yet. We're always screwed here in Limburg when it comes to these things.

My first impressions of it are pretty good. It's the first free news paper which doesn't copy and paste press releases. I always disliked the Metro and De Spits for just blatantly copying press releases (which in fact makes those two papers nearly identical). Let's just hope De Pers's distribution problems will quickly dissolve so I can read a decent paper in the morning.

P.S. It even contains Poker strategies! ;)
