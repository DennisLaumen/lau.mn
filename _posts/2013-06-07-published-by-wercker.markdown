This post was automatically published by [Wercker][wercker]! Wercker is a Dutch startup company which aims to make continuous delivery easy. I just added the Github repository of my Octopress blog, added a YAML file, and clicked some buttons in a slick web interface and my blog posts are automatically published once I push them to GitHub. Nice!
