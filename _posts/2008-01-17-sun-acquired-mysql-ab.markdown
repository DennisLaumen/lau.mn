[Yesterday Sun surprised probably everyone by announcing that they acquired MySQL AB for a huge amount a cash.](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/winds_of_change_are_blowing "Jonathan Schwartz's Blog: Helping Dolphins Fly") I really didn't see this one coming. Especially since Sun was backing MySQL's less popular but more advanced brother, PostgreSQL. I guess the dolphins beat the elephants this time.

I can't say I really understand the strategy behind this acquisition. Every article I read so far claims Sun bought MySQL in order to attack the very popular LAMP stack. I don't see Sun replacing Linux with Solaris and PHP with Java any day soon.
