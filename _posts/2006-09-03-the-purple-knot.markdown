After checking out Ubuntu's promising [Edgy preview](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/knot2 "Ubuntu Edgy Eft Knot 2") I decided to check out what the KDE guys were doing with Kubuntu.

Now I must warn you... I am not a big fan of KDE. I have tried it over numerous occasions and I never really connected with the whole glossy-power-user-thingy they are trying to do. I have always disliked the surplus of needless settings, the *bling bling* artwork and the overall inconsistency. I never felt the need to blog about it though.

After seeing [Kubuntu's Edgy preview](https://wiki.kubuntu.org/EdgyEft/Knot2/Kubuntu "Kubuntu Edgy Preview") I just feel the need to express myself. I don't know what hallucinating narKotics the artwork guys are on but Kubuntu's new theme looks horrible!

It's purple!

**Purple for crying out loud!**
