Liza Long:

> I am sharing this story because I am Adam Lanza’s mother. I am Dylan Klebold’s and Eric Harris’s mother. I am James Holmes’s mother. I am Jared Loughner’s mother. I am Seung-Hui Cho’s mother. And these boys—and their mothers—need help. In the wake of another horrific national tragedy, it’s easy to talk about guns. But it’s time to talk about mental illness.

America's proving it's not _that_ easy to talk about guns. Concrete steps to minimize gun violence are — even after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting — nowhere to be found. Liza Long has a point though, the focus on guns might distract from the more important discussion.
