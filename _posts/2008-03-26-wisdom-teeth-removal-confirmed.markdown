I had my **two bottom wisdom teeth** pulled this morning. I have been planning having them removed for probably a year now but it finally happened today. The reason I was waiting so long was two-fold. They **never hurt or irritated** me and these things always dangle at **the bottom of my priority list**.The surgery really was a **breeze**. Naturally I was a bit **nervous** up front but the **anesthetics** were probably the worst part of the whole ordeal. Those needles went pretty deep! The actual removal was literally **over before I realized it**. The **stitching was worse** because it was really an annoying feeling.The aftermath of the surgery is the worst though. I can barely open my mouth and the **wounds bled** for a couple of hours. Looking at the list of possible side effects I'm in pretty good shape though.
