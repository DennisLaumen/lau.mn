Dell is asking us on which of their products we would like to see Linux and which Linux distribution we would like to see. The survey can be found [here](http://www.dell.com/linuxsurvey "Dell Linux Survey") and it runs until March 23rd 2007.

Ubuntu is one of the distributions you can choose so [Planet Ubuntu-NL](http://planet.ubuntu-nl.org/ "Planet Ubuntu-NL")... Vote now!

P.S. On-topic enough for you JJ? ;)
