The first thing I did when I woke up this morning was browsing to the official [Ubuntu Linux website](http://www.ubuntulinux.org).

And yes, [Ubuntu Linux 5.10 Breezy Badger](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/) was released!

Do yourself and everyone else a favour (mostly the server people) and join the [torrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bittorrent)!

Nothing else to say at the moment...

*Dennis does a happy dance*

EDIT: After your download has finished, keep the torrent alive!
