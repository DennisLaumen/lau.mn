[Jason Fried][fried-twitter] getting some great advice from [Jeff Bezos][bezos-wikipedia]:

> He said people who were right a lot of the time were people who often changed their minds. He doesn’t think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It’s perfectly healthy — encouraged, even — to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today.
