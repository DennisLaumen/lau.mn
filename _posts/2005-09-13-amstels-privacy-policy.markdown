I got an e-mail today which kind of surprised me. Apparently I once entered some kind of competition or something similar at the [Amstel](http://www.amstel.nl) website.

Amstel is a Dutch beer brewery and their beer tastes like tasteless beer with a pinch of vomit. They are owned by [Heineken](http://blog.dfile.nl/www.heineken.nl), a brand name which will probably ring a bell.

The e-mail contained the following text (although I let [Babelfish](http://babelfish.altavista.com/) translate it to English for your reading pleasure):

> Dear Dennis,

The thing that surprised me wasn't the lousy translation by our friends at [AltaVista](http://www.altavista.com) but how nice those Amstel guys are.

According to this e-mail they actually delete old customer data and just stop harassing my mailbox if I don't sign up for the newsletter. Great!
