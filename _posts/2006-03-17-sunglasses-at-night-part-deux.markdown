Okay after [Loe](http://lgespee.blogspot.com "Loe Spee's weBlog") changed his hackergotchi I couldn't lag behind. Okay, that's a lie. My old [hackergotchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackergotchi "Wikipedia - Hackergotchi") wasn't really great (from a "I-Suck-At-[Gimp](http://www.gimp.org "GIMP")ing"-perspective) and Loe made me a new one last night.So here's the switcheroo...

Ye Olde One
