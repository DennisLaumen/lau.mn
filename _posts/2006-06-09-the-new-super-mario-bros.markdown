I went shopping yesterday and guess what I found...Correctomundo! The New Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo DS! It's a US import version, it's European release date is June 30th if I am not mistaken.

I must say this game is pure brilliance! It's like the older Mario games (think of Super Mario Bros. 1, 3 and Super Mario World) with 3D graphics (with 2D gameplay).

I'm off playing again, goodbye!
