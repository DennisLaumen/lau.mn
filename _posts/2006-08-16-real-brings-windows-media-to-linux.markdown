["RealNetworks will release open-source software this year that will let Linux computers play Windows Media files." - ZDNET](http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6105970.html "Real to plug Windows media support into Linux | Tech News on ZDNet")

Well not completely true. The codecs itself will be closed source but Real will bundle it with the open source Helix player. Nonetheless, this is a good development in my opinion. It's another sign that Linux on the desktop is slowly being taken seriously by big companies. It also solves some legal issues for businesses and ethical users.

Obviously, RealNetworks isn't doing this for philantropic reasons. The answer is in the same ZDNet article linked to in the top of this blog post:

> "Duchmann added that RealNetworks also hopes to bring its music store technology to Linux." - ZDNet

Although this motive is being played down I think it's the #1 reason for this move.
