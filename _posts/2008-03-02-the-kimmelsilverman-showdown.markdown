As a Dutchmen I'm not really into a lot of **American talk shows**. I really like The Daily Show and The Colbert Report and enjoy an occasional Conan-episode. I'm not really familiar with **Jimmy Kimmel** however.  Apparently he's dating **Sarah Silverman**, a comedienne whose show also airs in The Netherlands.  He also has a little running gag he uses every night in which **he bumps Matt Damon**. Combine those two factors and you get the following result...

Being a comedian himself Jimmy can't let Sarah and Matt do this to him without some **retaliation**.
