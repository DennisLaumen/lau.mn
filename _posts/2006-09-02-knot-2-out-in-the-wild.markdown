[Ubuntu Edgy Eft Knot 2 has just been released!](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/knot2 "Testing/Knot2")

I am not running Edgy yet but reading these summaries really makes me curious. Canonical is putting a lot of new stuff in there:

* Mono preinstalled! This makes it possible to include TomBoy and F-Spot by default.
* X.org 7.1, this apparently includes AIGLX. With Compiz apt-gettable this gives us easier access to "headache-inducing spinning cubes" as Corey Burger puts it.
* New versions of popular desktop applications like Firefox 2.0b1, OpenOffice.org 2.0.3, Gaim 2.0b3 and all the GNOME 2.16b2 goodness!
* Lots of optimizations and off course new versions of all the minor stuff like kernels and such ;).

Considering everything it looks like a very, very cool release so far and it doesn't even mention all the cool, experimental stuff like [Upstart](http://www.netsplit.com/blog/work/canonical/upstart.html "Upstart in Universe").
