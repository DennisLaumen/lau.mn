title: A question on source code etiquette

When writing code I personally prefer using tabs for indenting (instead of spaces). I also like to keep the width of the source code limited to 80 characters. These two "rules" unfortunately contradict each other. When using tabs for indentation one can never adapt to the 80 character rule.

What would you suggest? Drop the 80 character rule or just ignore the fact that other people might use a different indentation?

PS Tabs versus spaces for indentation is non-negotiable.
