After claiming my very first domain a couple of weeks ago (yay!) I finally did something usefull with it. I installed the [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) blogging software. That's what you are looking at right now, looks quite stylish doesn't it?

The installation went quite smooth, my [hostingprovider](http://www.flexwebhosting.nl) had some built-in tools in the admin panel which made the Wordpress installation easy. Just a couple of clicks and my new Blog was up and running!

I used to do some blogging at [Blogspot](http://djwjlaumen.blogspot.com) so if you want to see what I blogged in the past you could always check that out.
