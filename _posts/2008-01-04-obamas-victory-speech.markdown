I'm really hoping [Barack Obama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") will win the [2008 presidential election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008 "United States presidential election, 2008 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"). That's not at all based on his political ideas. I'm no American citizen so I can't say I'm informed enough to pass judgment on his ideas. My political preference in this race to the White House is based purely on his public speaking skills. Check out [this video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=yqoFwZUp5vc "Obama's Victory Speech") of his [victory speech yesterday in Iowa](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/03/iowa.caucuses/ " Huckabee, Obama have huge night in Iowa - CNN.com").

His oratory skills are really, really good. Add that to his charm and natural leadership and most politically uninformed people (like me) would agree that this guy could well be on his way to the White House.
