A guy from my class started blogging after I pressured him into it. I guess I owe him some advertising space on this high-traffic blog of mine ;).

[DeV's blog](http://blog.dvolve.org "DeV's blog") (His real name is Steven Thewissen but I guess he thinks he is anonymous on the internet or something)

I believe his usual array of topics include:

- Life.
- Video games.
- Wrestling.

Enjoy!
