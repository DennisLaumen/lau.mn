Finally!This is what I've been waiting for since the birth of the DVD... A decent [Blade](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/ "Blade Runner IMDb") [Runner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner "Blade Runner Wikipedia") release!

They already released a really cheap director's cut edition in those annoying ugly cardboard thingies... But that probably didn't sell (because the cardboard packaging was already decomposing in the shelf) so they never reprinted them.

[Today CNN brings us great news, a 25th-anniversary edition will be released shortly.](http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/30/film.bladerunner.reut/index.html "'Blade Runner' to get 'final cut' re-release") It will be a multi disc release containing all the different versions of the film:

- The original theatrical cut.
- The expanded international theatrical cut.
- The 1992 director's cut.
- The 'final cut' (which is some kind of new edit).

Let's just hope Warner releases this in Europe as well...
