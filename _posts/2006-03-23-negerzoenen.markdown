I have no idea how these thing are called in English:

![Negerzoenen](/wp-content/uploads/negerzoenen.jpg)

But here in the Netherlands we call them _negerzoenen_ which roughly translates as _negro kisses_. These things were always named _negerzoenen_, up until this day...

Apparently this was considered racist so these _negerzoenen_ are now called _zoenen_ (just kisses).

Political correctness will kill us some day...

I call for a ban of the following products:
- _blanke vla_;
- _jodenkoeken;_
- _zigeunersaus;_
- _moorkoppen;_
- _afrikaantjes;_
