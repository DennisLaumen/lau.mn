I purchased the [The Office](http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/theoffice/) DVD box last week. A hilarious show! And coincidentally it also features [Arthur Dent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Dent "Arthur Dent"), [Pascal](http://pmjdebruijn.blogspot.com/2006/06/blackadder-ii.html "Pascal")!

This time around it's not [Simon Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Jones_%28actor%29 "Simon Jones") from the Hitchiker's series but [Martin Freeman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Freeman "Martin Freeman"), who portrayes Arthur in [the Hitchhiker movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/ "The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy").
