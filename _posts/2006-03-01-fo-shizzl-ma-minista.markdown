I have known for a while that The Netherlands as a country are going insane but the following will once again confirm my suspicion.

Our minister of justice, [Piet Hein Donner](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Hein_Donner) (sorry guys Dutch link!) who is probably our most conservative minister, has just released a [rap song](http://www.justitie.nl/organisatie/minister_donner/Nieuwsberichten/60225Donner_rap_drugsbeleid.asp) ([MP3](http://www.justitie.nl/Images/DeDonfeatMeesterG_tcm74-107706.mp3) &amp;&amp; [WMV](http://cgi.omroep.nl/cgi-bin/streams?/nos/nieuws/2006/februari/video/250206/donnerrap.wmv)). In it he basically states that drugs are not cool...Yeah really impressive man! It will probably make the "urban youth" think twice before lighting another joint.

And for my Dutch readers... sorry for the late post but we had carnival here in the south ;).
