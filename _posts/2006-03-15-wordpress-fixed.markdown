[My Wordpress installation is finally fixed.](http://blog.dfile.nl/archives/39)

Something probably went wrong in the FTP uploads the first try. The second try didn't go great as well as I still had some scrambled logo's here and there. Uploading the logo's again fixed this issue.

When faced with the same problems I had my advice is simple: re-upload (is that a word?).
