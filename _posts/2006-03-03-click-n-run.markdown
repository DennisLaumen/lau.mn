Apparently [Kevin Carmony](http://www.linspire.com/lindows_about_profiles.php) is thinking about supplying Ubuntu with some [CNR](http://www.linspire.com/products_cnr_whatis.php?tab=whatis) love.

I think it's a great idea, if done correctly that is, to bring commercial software packages to Ubuntu in a user friendly way. Installing third-party products on Ubuntu can be quite a hassle but a product like click and run could really make this a lot easier for users. It would also provide users to legally use some [restricted formats](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats).

[Jerome Gotangco](http://loktarogar.blogspot.com/2006/03/speculations.html) &amp;&amp; [Jorge Castro](http://www.whiprush.org/2006/03/cnr_for_ubuntu_.html) already posted about this topic. Their blogs can also be found on the mighty fine international [Planet Ubuntu](http://planet.ubuntulinux.org).
