A couple of weeks ago I picked up [Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Justice For All](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney_-_Justice_for_All "Ace Attorney - Justice For All - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") for my Nintendo DS. The Phoenix Wright games are quite difficult to categorize. They are best described as a mix between old school point-and-click adventure games and an interactive novel. I haven't finished the game yet (I'm working on the last case) but it has been pretty good so far.

Because I enjoyed *Justice For All* so much I am looking forward to the game's sequels. The third game in the series, [Trials and Tribulations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney_-_Trials_and_Tribulations "Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"), will be coming out in Europe very soon. These three games form a trilogy which was originally released in Japan on the Gameboy Advance a couple of years ago. The fourth game in the series (and the start of a new trilogy) will have it's European release in March. This game is the first to feature a new protagonist, Apollo Justice, and is the first real DS release in the series.
