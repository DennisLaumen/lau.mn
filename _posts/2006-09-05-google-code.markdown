Yesterday I applied for a project at code.google.com to host a small project I just started. The project isn't anything yet except for a few Glade files and a couple of Python scripts glueing it together.

When applying for the project a name conflict was detected with a project on sourceforge.  Apparently Google indexed the names for the projects on SourceForge (I assume they also indexed FreshMeat and the likes), which is pretty cool. After detecting the name conflict an e-mail was sent to the maintainer of the SourceForge project asking him for approval of the project name. The maintainer already contacted me and I expect to get his approval shortly.

It looks like a pretty cool service so far. Very simple, very clean. Can't wait to start using it.
