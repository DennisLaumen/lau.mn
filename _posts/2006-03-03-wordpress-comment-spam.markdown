I am getting more and more comment spam on my [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) blog recently.

Just a quick question to the WordPress users out there. There are a lot of anti-spam comment plugins out there. Which one are you using? Which one do you suggest me to try?

I would prefer a non-[CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha) solution as it's pretty ruthless on the visually impaired.
