And yet another Ubuntu derivative: [Ubuntu Lite](http://www.ubuntulite.org)!

I really love their slogan: "Ubuntu power for slow machines". It is so lame it's almost good!

The idea sounds pretty cool, a lightweight and small Ubuntu distro (Damn Small Ubuntu ;)). For daily usage [Xubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu) is probably more suitable at the moment but hey! It's more Ubuntu love! ;)
