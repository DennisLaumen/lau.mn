This week a friend of mine sent me a great [link](http://www.tcnj.edu/~hofmann/Granby/Granby.htm). Although this happened approximately one year ago I never heard this story until last week.

This guy, Marvin Heemeyer, was one angry guy... He had some type of conflict with the local government so he decided to build himself an armored bulldozer and tear the village down.

Check out some of the damage he did (click on the first link to see some more pictures):
