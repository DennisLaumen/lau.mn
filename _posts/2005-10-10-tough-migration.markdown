As you might have read in my previous post, I used to blog at [Blogspot](http://www.blogspot.com).

Something I would really like to do is preserve my posts and comments of my Blogspot blog. I found a good tutorial for it [here](http://catsutorials.catsudon.org/?p=15).

It isn't working yet but that is probably because of an error on my side. It is late and I am tired. I am going to bed and try again tomorrow.

Good night...
