Great article by [Steven Levy][steven-levy] on [Wired.com][wired] on how Google runs its data centers (although there's a lot of retreading from the excellent [In The Plex][in-the-plex]). As a software engineer I was especially envious when reading the following paragraph:

> This is tremendously empowering for the people who write Google code. Just as your computer is a single device that runs different programs simultaneously—and you don’t have to worry about which part is running which application—Google engineers can treat seas of servers like a single unit. They just write their production code, and the system distributes it across a server floor they will likely never be authorized to visit.

It's incredible how often <del>hardware </del>reality interferes with my awesome code.
