I just stumbled across this [link](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/rejected/index.html) on [OSNews](http://www.osnews.com) and I found it hilarious.

What it basically is (for people too lazy to click the link), is a collection of really funny ads by Sun Microsystems that didn't make the cut and they contain texts like *100% more bitchin' than Dell* and *Now that's what we call an ass-whoopin'*.Ah well, enough blabbering just click the darn link!
