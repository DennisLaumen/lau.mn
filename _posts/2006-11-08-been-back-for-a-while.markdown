After coming [back from holiday](/2006/10/13/hooray-hooray-its-a-holi-holiday.html "Hooray Hooray, it's a Holi-Holiday") a couple of weeks ago I haven't blogged anymore. This post should mark my return to the blogosphere (buzz ;)).

I went with my girlfriend and her parents to their house in France and did absolutely nothing for a complete week. And nothing really means absolutely nothing. To prove my point I will give you an example of an ordinary day:

- Wake up.
- Swim.
- Breakfast.
- Read.
- Eat.
- Read.
- Swim.
- Eat.
- Read.
- Sleep.

Which pretty much sums up my whole week. Of course we also left the house a couple of times to hike a bit, enjoy nature and take some photographs. We also visited some of the beautiful, little villages in the vicinity.

Not being able or just refusing to use computers, internet, mobile phones, phones in general, television etc. was strangely relaxing. Our day-to-day lives pretty much revolve around these machines and not having them around dictating my day was [grrreat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_the_Tiger "Tony the Tiger")!
