Don't ask me what I did to piss off the printers of the world...

Before wednesday's exam I tried printing some stuff I needed before the exam... But alas... My laser printers toner was empty.

Before thursday's exam I tried printing some stuff I needed before the exam... But alas... My inkjet printers cartridges were empty.

Quickly hurried to school to print the last few pages on one of the school's laser printers... PAPER JAM!!!

I don't know what I did in the past to piss off the world's printers but I sure hope they will start acting nice to me in the following days.
