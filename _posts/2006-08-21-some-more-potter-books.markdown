[After I finished the first book](http://blog.dfile.nl/archives/114 "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone") I immediately started reading the second book, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*. Having finished it a couple of days ago I must admit it is a lot better than the first book. The first book had some weak chapters (the first few), book two definitely does not have a weak start. All the characters are already introduced so there is no time wasted introducing everybody and everything (the book is still readable without reading the first book as everyone is introduced briefly throughout the story).

Of course new characters and new elements in the wizarding world are introduced to keep it all fresh and exciting. All the remarks made in context to the second book definitely apply to the third book, _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_, which is even better than the second.I already started reading book four of the series: _Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire_. The first three or four chapters are a pretty exciting start so I think I am in for a treat. Noteworthy is the number of pages of book four: 796 pages! Pretty hefty for a children's book, especially when considering book one and two combined don't have that many pages.
