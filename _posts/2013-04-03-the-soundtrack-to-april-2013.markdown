Another month, another _Soundtrack_ by [Phil Wilce][wilce]. If you're interested in new music this series of Spotify playlists are must-listens!

> April is fully loaded. 50 live rounds. All hit the bulls-eye.
> 
> From the raucous hellfire of Major Lazer and Tyga. To the deadly sniper attack of Misty Miller and Kodaline. 
>
> There are carefully picked-off targets from the new albums by Peace, Low, Devendra Banhart and Steve Mason
>
> And a brutal attack from Vision.
