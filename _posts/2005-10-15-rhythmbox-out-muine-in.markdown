title: Rhythmbox out, Muine in

Our good friend the Breezy Badger has behaved himself pretty good the last few days. The only thing that still irritates me about it is [Rhythmbox](http://www.rhythmbox.org/).

This application is really driving me crazy! On every install I do it works for approximately two days and after that it just stops working. According to the debug output, segmentation faults occur. If I understood correctly this means that Rhythmbox is trying to access memory it isn't allowed to (correct me if I am wrong). I wonder why applications like these are being used as the standard music player in Ubuntu? And yeah I already filed a bug...

Anyway to get to the point. After being harrassed by [Spacey](http://users.lichtsnel.nl/~spacey/) for ages (just kidding Spacey!)  on IRC (#ubuntu-nl on Freenode) to give [Muine](http://muine.gooeylinux.org/) a try I finally did (again, the first time wasn't such a joyous occasion).

And I must say: It's great! It takes a couple of minutes to get used to because of the 'weird' interface, but after you get the hang of it, it's really great! Do remember to install the muine-plugin-trayicon to be able to control the application from the tray icon.

Here's a screenshot of Muine:![Muine](/public/images/muine.png)
