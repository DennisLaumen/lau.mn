The second season of [Prison Break](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Break "Prison Break") started yesterday. Definitely a good show if you like action/thriller-type tv series. The first season ended a couple of months a go and was pretty good. Not the best show ever and it definitely had some serious flaws (especially in the first few episodes) but it was a pretty tense show nonetheless.

The first episode of the second season aired last night in the U.S. and after watching it I am sure season two will be as exciting as the first. If you watched the first season you owe it to yourself to watch this new episode and if you haven't seen the first season, go watch it now!

Big drawback to Prison Break starting again is that my craving for new [Lost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_%28TV_series%29 "Lost") episodes is becoming nearly unbearable. Unfortunately, I will have to wait untill October 4.
