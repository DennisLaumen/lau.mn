Yes, it's true...

THEY... work for ME...

![Microsoft Works For Me](http://blog.dfile.nl/wp-content/uploads/microsoft_works_for_me_resized_compressed.jpg)Yes, [Bill Gates](http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php/Bill_Gates) and [Steve Ballmer](http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/Ballmer) are my employees and they dance to my tunes ([iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/)?)!

I made these funny pictures myself with my [Nokia 6680](http://europe.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/phones/6680). Great phone, there is only one true downside (apart from some minor irritations) to this phone. It can't sync to [evolution](http://www.gnome.org/projects/evolution/)!!!

Oh yeah, just to be sure. [Don't panic!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchhiker%27s_guide_to_the_galaxy) The software isn't mine!
