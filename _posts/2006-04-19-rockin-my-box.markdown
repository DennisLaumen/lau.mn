While quietly enjoying my Easter weekend I stumbled upo this great piece of software:

As the subtitle in the picture says it's open source jukebox firmware, which basically means it's a replacement firmware for the following models:

- Archos: Jukebox 5000, 6000, Studio, Recorder, FM Recorder, Recorder V2 and Ondio
- iRiver: H100 and H300 series
- Apple: iPod 4G (grayscale and color), 5G (Video), Nano and Mini 2G
- iAudio: X5 (including X5V and X5L)
- Additional models are [in development](http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/TargetStatus "Models in development")

Owning a good ol' 4G iPod myself I decided to [try it out](http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/ManualRockboxInstall "Rockbox installation"). Not that there is anything wrong with the Apple firmware. It just lacks Ogg Vorbis and FLAC support, which sucks!

Rockbox however does support it. The interface itself is a bit less user-friendly as the original firmware is but makes up for it in features. The features are truely limitless... (It for now lacks [Last.Fm](http://www.last.fm "Last.Fm")/Audioscrobbler support but a patch for future versions is already created)

Installation was pretty easy. The only exciting part was installing the bootloader (which gives you an option to boot into the original firmware). Installing the firmware itself is as easy as dropping a folder on your player's hard drive.If you own one of the aforementioned *jukeboxes* and are feeling adventurous I suggest you give it a spin!
