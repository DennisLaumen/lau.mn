The first new thing I noticed when installing an Alpha version of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com "Ubuntu Linux") [Feisty Fawn](http://www.ubuntu.com/testing/ "Ubuntu Testing") was an addition to Ubiquity, Ubuntu's LiveCD installer. This addition is the Migration Assistant.

The Migration Assistant helps new users migrate to Ubuntu (as it's name implies ;)). It pops up somewhere in the installation process and scans the system's hard drive(s) and checks whether or not another operating system is installed. I couldn't test it because I was installing Feisty in [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/ "VMWare").

It looks very good though. It should import your documents and settings from other Linux distributions and (more importantly) from Windows. It imports everything from instant messenger settings, address book and e-mail messages to user accounts, desktop backgrounds and internet connection settings. The  way it imports documents is really nice as well. When for example MP3's are found in a user's Windows XP installation it imports the MP3's to the new Ubuntu installation and places it in the ``~/Music`` folder and automagically sets up Rhythmbox to add those files to it's music library.

It looks like a very, very useful tool, especially for people coming from the Windows world and wanting to setup their new Ubuntu installation without too much hassle. I wasn't able to test it however so I can't judge the application's maturity and stability. If you want to try it out: be my guest. But remember: backup, backup, backup, backup, backup!
