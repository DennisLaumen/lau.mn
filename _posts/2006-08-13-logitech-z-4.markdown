Friday my new 2.1 speaker set finally arrived. It was ordered a while back but had a little delay because of another product being in back order. My set of choice was the [Logitech Z-4](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2173,CONTENTID=10937 "Logitech Z-4"). I picked them because they sounded like the best speakers within my budget. Overall, online reviews are pretty positive and a little test drive in the local Media Markt demonstrated it's crisp sound and lack of distortion at higher volumes (which is pretty essential as I like [my music](http://www.last.fm/user/DennisLaumen/ "Last.fm: Dennis Laumen") loud :)).

Unfortunately I had to work the whole weekend so I didn't have time to test the set properly. After about half a day of playing around with the set I must say I am very satisfied with it. Definitely an improvement over my previous *Manufactured by Creative*, 6 euro speakers.
