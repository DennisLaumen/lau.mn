Yesterday I paid Jeroen a visit. I dropped by to play some games with him but his lousy Xbox360 crapped out. Apparently it didn't boot and three red lights burned... sounded promising ;).

So we decided to rent some DVD's. One of the films we rented was [The 40 Year Old Virgin](http://imdb.com/title/tt0405422/ "The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005)"). Really a great comedy!

Anyway the point I am trying to make is meant for [Ramon](http://ramon.dfile.nl "Ragnarok Now"): Yes, everybody thought he was a serial killer and yes he had an accident while riding his bicycle... ;)
