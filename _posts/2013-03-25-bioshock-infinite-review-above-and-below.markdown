The original BioShock is probably my favorite game of the past console 
generation. Naturally, I'm extremely excited for its successor BioShock
Infinite. All the glowing reviews only add to my excitement. Check out 
Polygon's 10!

Arthur Gies for Polygon:

> I'm still thinking about BioShock Infinite now, days after finishing. Irrational built a believable, fantastic world rooted in dark pieces of American history. But for everything it has to say, for all the questions it asks —many of which have no easy answers — BioShock Infinite's big thoughts and complicated narrative don't obscure the brilliant action game that carries those messages through. It's hard to know if Infinite will prove to be another major point of artistic discussion and development of the medium the way that BioShock was. But in every way, BioShock Infinite lives up to the promise of its legacy, and it looks poised to establish a new one.
