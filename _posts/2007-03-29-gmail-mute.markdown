I just accidentally discovered a cool, little feature in Gmail. I just pressed the wrong keyboard shortcut (I pressed the 'm' button on the keyboard while reading a message) and a small message popped up saying _"The conversation has been muted."_. The consequence of muting a conversation is that all future messages in that thread will go directly into your archive. Quite a nifty feature for people subscribed to mailing lists.
