Dear [Pascal](http://blog.pcode.nl/?p=204 "P#: Lossy Search"),

I've worked with MySQL during my internship. I implemented a lossy search back then using [regular expressions](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/regexp.html "Regular Expressions").

PostgreSQL also supports [regular expressions](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/interactive/functions-matching.html "Pattern Matching") (although I don't have any experience with it).

Yours sincerely,

Dennis
