I just got my badge to the [LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo](http://www.linuxworldexpo.nl) today. I almost forgot about it because [VNU Exhibitions](http://www.vnuexpo.com/), the organisation behind the conference, took very long to send me this badge. I am really looking forward to it though!Stupid thing about the LinuxWorld Expo website is that it runs on a Windows 2000 Server with IIS 5.0. When I saw that in september I immediately mailed them. Luckily I got a pretty nice reaction back from one of the project managers. She said that it was kind of awkward indeed but that it was a company wide decision. She did spread a memo through the office so hopefully something will change in the future.
