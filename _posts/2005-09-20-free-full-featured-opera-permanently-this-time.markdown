[Opera](http://www.opera.com) already surprised me a couple of weeks a go when they gave away free license keys.

This time they really made me happy! They are going to offer Opera for free and without any limitations! This should make the *browser war* even more interesting, [another free competitor](http://www.getfirefox.com)!

If you haven't used Opera before you should really grab [this opportunity](http://www.opera.com/free/) and try it! It really is an amazing piece of software...
