The [Apple](http://www.apple.com/ "Apple Inc.") notebook event just finished and for me personally it was a disappointing event overall.  I was looking for a new computer and was considering a MacBook. With the rate the prices of Windows-based laptops are dropping the last couple of years I was expecting Apple to offer a cheaper alternative to it's previous offerings. I didn't expect them to drop the Apple premium price tag but did expect a pricing between the old one and Windows-based machines (the rumored $800-$899).Now that all the new products and their pricing are announced you can understand my disappointment. The old MacBooks are now sold for $999 and the new models (which are incredibly sexy) start at $1299. Way too expensive if you're asking me and a pretty stupid move on Apple's part. The current economic downfall makes pricing a more important feature than ever and Apple just priced themselves out of the market for most people.
