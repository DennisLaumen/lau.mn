Before using my *@dfile.nl* e-mail address I primarily used a GMail address. I loved it! GMail's webinterface is vastly superior to any e-mail webinterface I used. When Google started the [GMail for Domains](https://www.google.com/hosted "GMail for Domains") beta-test I immediately signed up for it.

Last week I got invited for the test. All I had to do was change some MX-records. Now I can use the GMail webinterface and Google's diskspace (2 gigabytes per user I decide to create ;)) for my mail while still retaining my *@dfile.nl* address.

It isn't much different from the normal GMail experience. There's an extra admin panel which allows you to add extra users (manually or using a CSV file) and aliasses (including a *catch-all*). It's an equal experience from a user perspective though, with the exception of not having Google Calendar integration yet (which some users already have, being rolled out while we speak... uhm write... uhm read).
