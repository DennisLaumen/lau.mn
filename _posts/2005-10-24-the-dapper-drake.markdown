If the reactions on our IRC channel (#ubuntu-nl op irc.freenode.net)  and [Dennis's blog](http://www.kaarsemaker.net) are representative for the Dutch people, everyone in the Netherlands assumes that the English word _drake_ (The next Ubuntu release will be codenamed [Dapper Drake](http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=350378)) means _dragon_ (the Dutch word for dragon is _draak_).

As some of you might know, this is far from the truth! A drake is not even remotely as dangerous as a dragon, it is just a male duck! It might sound a lot less tough but it sounds a lot better when comparing it to the animals used in the previous codenames: warthog, hedgehog and badger.

To make the story complete: The English word _dapper_ has nothing to do with courage (the Dutch word for courage is... _dapper_!) . Dapper is just another word for fashionable or well dressed.

Our next [Ubuntu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Linux) release will be named after a [metrosexual](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrosexual) duck!
