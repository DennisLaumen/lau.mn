I've been having a lot of fun reading lately. So let's just skim through the titles I finished this month (and hadn't blogged about yet).

In chronological order and rated using the well known five star system (well asterisks aren't really stars but hey... sue me):
- Terry Pratchett - The Colour Of Magic (\*\*\*\*)
This was the first Discworld novel I read. I only knew the Discworld universe through the adventure games I used to play on my good ol' Amiga.The book is pretty good although confusing at times. Pratchett sometimes switches from one scene to another without any visual hint (there are no chapters and he barely uses the \*\*\* indicators). Apart from this minor flaw the book is hilarious! I'd recommend it to everybody... well every geek I suppose.

- Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (\*\*\*\*\*)
The fifth book in the well known series. Loved it! Better and darker than the first four books.

- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (\*\*\*\*\*)
The sixth book in the same series. Loved this one as well! It would be hard to pick a favourite between this book and the *The Order of the Phoenix*.

- Dan Brown - Digital Fortress (\*\*)
This book was horrible. The first two Dan Brown books I read were okay. They had their flaws but were very thrilling which made up for a lot. Although this book is thrilling as well it is horribly crippled by some aspects of the book. The book is filled with technical mistakes concerning computers and algorithms and the likes. Brown states two former NSA employees were consulted when writing the book. Next time he should consider asking why they were former employees. Portraying the EFF as paranoid freaks didn't really help the book either (it was pretty American overall). Last but not least it was very clear Susan Fletcher (the books female protagonist) is clearly Brown's dream woman. He describes how every man drools when they see her at least once a chapter (that's a lot considering Brown's chapters are four pages on average) and never fails to notice that she is the most brilliant cryptographer at the NSA. It's a miracle her boyfriend survived the book ;).

- Harry Potter's School Books (\*\*\*\*)These two books were written for charity (Comic Relief). They're two of Harry's school books featured in the series: Newt Scamander's *Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them* and Kennilworthy Whisp's *Quidditch Through the Ages* Both are fantastic little (approximately 50 pages) books. Especially  *Beasts..* was hilarious. It's filled with funny remarks by Harry, Ron and Hermione as well ("Write in your own book Hermione!").

Today I started reading the second Discworld novel: *The Light Fantastic*. Looking pretty good so far.
