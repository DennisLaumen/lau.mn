I hadn't heard of this project yet: [The Metisse project](http://www.mandriva.com/projects/metisse "The Metisse Project").

It's yet another project trying to innovate the Linux desktop. Although I don't see this catching on big time it does present some interesting new ways of interacting with windows.

I especially like the folding windows in the copy-paste demo and the feature which gives you an overview of every virtual desktop.
