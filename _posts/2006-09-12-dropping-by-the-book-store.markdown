I am never able to escape these stores empty handed. The same happened to me today.

As you may have read in [some](/2006/08/16/harry-potter-and-the-philosophers-stone.html "Book 1") [previous](/2006/08/21/some-more-potter-books.html "Book 2 & 3") [blog posts](/2006/09/10/finished-reading-book-four.html) I have been reading the Harry Potter books for the last couple of weeks. I just finished book four this weekend and didn't have book five waiting for me at home (which is a rather peculiar but that's a completely different topic). Which meant paying a visit to the book store.

Arriving at the book store I immediately ran for the English literature section. I'm very fond of British literature so that section is usually the one I aim for first. It's not that I don't like Dutch literature however, I just don't like it as much as British literature. A lot of interesting stuff could be found on the shelves.

My loot for today however:

* [Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - J.K. Rowling](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Harry-Potter-Order-Phoenix/dp/0747570728/ref=sr_11_1/202-2144733-0871857?ie=UTF8 "Harry Potter Book 5"): Book five in the series and the only book I actually visited the store for in the first place.
* [Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - J.K. Rowling](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Harry-Potter-Half-blood-Prince-Children-s-/dp/0747584672/ref=sr_11_1/202-2144733-0871857?ie=UTF8 "Harry Potter Book 6"): Book six in the series, I guessed I needed it in a week or two anyway so this saved me another trip to the book store.
- [The Magician's Nephew - C.S. Lewis](http://www.amazon.co.uk/-Magician-s-Nephew-Chronicles-Narnia-S-/dp/000720227X/ref=sr_11_1/202-2144733-0871857?ie=UTF8 "The Magician's Nephew"): Part one in the 'Chronicles of Narnia' series. Haven't seen the movie(s?), have no idea what it's about but Leon recommended it so it's probably worth reading.
- [Digital Fortress - Dan Brown](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Fortress/dp/0552151696/ref=sr_11_1/202-2144733-0871857?ie=UTF8 "Digital Fortress"): Dan Brown's debut novel, the author best known for 'The Da Vinci Code'. Like 'The Da Vinci Code' and '[Angels and Demons](/2006/08/14/angels-and-demons.html "Angels and Demons")' this book will probably be very exciting as well.
One deception though: The Computer Science section contained [**NO** Ubuntu books](http://blogs.ubuntu-nl.org/dennis/2006/09/11/ubooktu/ "Dennis Kaarsemakers found them!")!
