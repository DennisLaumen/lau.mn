Just like [Loe](http://lgespee.blogspot.com/2006/08/beagle-dog-i-like-rhythmbox-or-banshee.html "Rhythmbox or Banshee") I am having difficulty on deciding on a music player for Ubuntu. There are several options:

* [Rhythmbox](http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/ "Rhythmbox")
* [Banshee](http://banshee-project.org/Main_Page "Banshee")
* [Muine](http://muine-player.org/wiki/Main_Page "Muine")
* [Quod Libet](http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet "Quod Libet")
* [Listen](http://listengnome.free.fr/ "Listen")
* [Exaile](http://www.exaile.org/ "Exaile")

Right now, Exaile and Quod Libet aren't real options however.

Quod Libet's interface is WAY too confusing! You can adapt the interface to your personal needs but honestly I don't want to, I just want reasonable defaults.

Exaile's interface is just as horrible, although I must admit I am basing this solely on screenshots. It has vertical tabs for crying out loud! And I really, really hate vertical tabs! Furthermore I really don't fancy browsing through 3000+ FLAC's with a treeview.

All other options (Rhythmbox, Banshee, Muine and Listen) have some serious flaws as well but are applications I could see myself using despite their flaws. Just like Loe I will probably devote a blogpost containing pros and cons for each one of them (sorry for stealing your thunder, mate ;)).
