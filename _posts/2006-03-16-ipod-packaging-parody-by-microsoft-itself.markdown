**UPDATE:** Finally that damn embedded Google video works :D.

Hmm... If this turns out to be correct those guys at Redmond _do_ have a sense of humour.

The following movie was showed to me by [Loe](http://lgespee.blogspot.com "Loe Spee - weBlog") a couple of weeks a go. I thought it was a hilarious parody of Microsoft's product packaging.

[Apparently Microsoft created the video themselves for internal use... weird...](http://www.ipodobserver.com/story/25957 "iPod Observer")
