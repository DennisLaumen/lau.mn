So I was bored for 40 minutes this afternoon (while taking a break from my boring math homework) and I decided to install [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) on my server. Everybody probably read about it or seen the [screencasts](http://www.rubyonrails.org/screencasts) (defintely a viewing tip), so an introduction won't be necessary (I am really to lazy to be honest).

It was pretty easy to install. The wiki wasn't the clearest description ever on how to configure your system to run Ruby on Rails so I decided to sacrifice some virgins to the search engine gods and see what they would come up with.

[This was the result...](http://fo64.com/articles/2005/10/20/rails-on-breezy)
