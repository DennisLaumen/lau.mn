After a couple of weeks of holiday (in which I barely had any spare time, didn't relax enough and didn't get to do any of the things I planned to do) school started again today.

I was really motivated before the first class but my motivation immediately plummeted when I arrived at school. Nothing was prepared, it was one organizational mess. One day of school, one day wasted. Great average, guys!

*Mentally preparing for tomorrow*
