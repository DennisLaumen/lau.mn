[Today Maria van der Hoeven announced that a culturecard will be introduced in the Netherlands](http://www.nrc.nl/binnenland/article431346.ece "Cultuurpas") (Dutch link).

The idea is simple, give high school kids a prepaid card with 15 euros to spend on culture (per year). Sounds a fine idea at first.

It turns out however that kids can not only visit museums, art galleries and the likes but can also go to concerts, movie theaters and buy DVD's. Great! Government sponsored Britney Spears DVD's... Free 50 Cent concerts!

Personally I think they should make museums, art galleries and the likes free for high school students.
