Aargh! Too many screaming caps in my title! ;)

Anyday... Anyway... This blogpost is meant for [Pascal de Bruijn](http://pmjdebruijn.blogspot.com) (Google juice! Google juice!).

Apparently the ADO.NET/OLEDB difference was kind of what I said it was. The best _easy_ explanation could be found [here](http://www.experts-exchange.com/Databases/Q_20825207.html) (Severe scrolling behind this link, do some finger excercises before clicking the link!).

Here some wikipedia links for anyone interested:

- [ADO.NET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADO.NET);
- [OLEDB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLE_DB);
- [ODBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odbc);
