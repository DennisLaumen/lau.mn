Although I fell asleep while watching the movie (don't remember if it was caused by the quality of the movie or the quality of my sleep the day before). I always intended reading at least the first book in the series, I just had to know what the fuss is about.

So last week I picked up *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* by *J.K. Rowling*. Although I expected to hate it I finished reading it in a couple of days and enjoyed every minute of it. Although the first couple of chapters are a bit slow, the book overall is excellent. It is off course a children's book so it's a bit simple at times but the world and the characters Rowling creates are sparkling, fresh and funny. Definitely a book I would recommend everyone, young and old.

Having enjoyed the book so much I decided to buy *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* (the second book) and *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* (the third) as well. Just to make sure I don't run out of unread books. I already started reading book two a couple of days a go and so far it's even better as the first.
