What other title could I have picked for my first post? I'm a programmer with a lame sense of humor for God's sake! Get over it!Anyway don't take this first post to serious. I had to create it to preview the template I chose.

As a matter of fact, don't take any of my posts to serious. I just needed a place to whine...
