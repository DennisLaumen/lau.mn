I was browsing on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com "Amazon") a bit just a couple of minutes a go. I was trying to check out some reviews of my recently acquired [Mozart CD Box](http://emiclassics.com/phpNewSite/catalogue/tracklisting.php?search=true&tracklist=330381 "Best Mozart 100") (Classical music really improves my programming productivity!).

I didn't find it by just typing Best Mozart 100 so I thought I would just punch in the EAN and find it that way. I didn't find the CD though. I found [this book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0833030477/ref=sib_rdr_dp/102-2115984-7920105?%5Fencoding=UTF8&me=ATVPDKIKX0DER&no=283155&st=books&n=283155 "Amazon.com: A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates (Paperback) ") instead!

And yes, it's a book containing random digits... You can use the Search Inside functionality provided by Amazon to flip through the pages... All you'll see are random digits :D.

And for your reading pleasure: Check out the really lame reader reviews!
