Sometimes disasters have some pretty funny side effects...

Katrina, New Orleans' favourite hurricane, apparently helped some [killer dolphins](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1577753,00.html) escape and these homicidal animals are currently hunting terrorists by the Gulf of Mexico.

Yes, indeed there is nothing wrong with your eyes!!! The U.S. has been training killer dolphins since the cold war!!!
