*Ragnarok Now*
*Giggling at mankinds inevitable downfall*

Great title for a blog! And you can find it [here](http://ramon.dfile.nl "Ragnarok Now")...

It's a new blog by a friend of mine. He hasn't blogged anything yet so I don't now what he will blog about in the future. I could make a guess though:

- Anything remotely apocalyptic;
- Anything remotely despicable;
- Anything remotely related to politics;
- Anything remotely related to terrorism;

Anyway enjoy his new blog...
