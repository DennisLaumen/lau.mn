![Printer eats Windows Vista DVD](http://static.flickr.com/57/169501392_0d608f5fd6.jpg?v=0)

That's my printer eating the Windows Vista DVD! This must be some sort of sign... *"Beware of the Dark Side, Dennis!"* On a serious note though. That's the third DVD screwed because of Vista. The first two were f*cked up because of Microsoft spreading this thing through HTTP (Of course there's the Akamai alternative for which you need ActiveX and a Windows OS) and not providing MD5 hashes. The third DVD (now in my printer) was untested but was probably in good state as it was transferred through one of the unofficial torrents.
